This is a demo for a work project. It uses React, Express and Material UI. It's a simple concept for a dashboard to view events.

To get up and running you'll need to:
 1) Clone the project
 2) CD into the folder
 3) run npm install or yarn depending upon your preference
 4) In a seperate terminal cd into the sever folder and run npm install for server dependencies
 5) To star the server simply run: Node app
 6) To start the React app run: Yarn start or Node start
 7) There's no CRUD funtionality to the app it just displays events 
 
 Anyone is welcome to use this if they want.
